Tests with kernel 4.3 were not successful so far as the module did not load. But I haven't really looked into it. Debian stable (jessie) and kernel 3.18 works fine so far.\r\n \r\nThe only part of the driver which is actually open-source is the kernel interface. Everything else is just blobs.\r\nSo it can't really be considered OSS and it's unlikely that it will ever be included in the debian package tree.\r\nHere is a package repo for the driver. In case there will ever be updates I'll update that one too.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget -O - http://p.l42.at/signing-pub.key | sudo apt-key add -\r\necho \"deb http://p.l42.at/debian jessie main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rr272x.list\r\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install rr272x-dkms\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
