Everything else is just blobs.\r\nSo it can't really be considered OSS and it's unlikely that it will ever be included in the debian package tree.\r\nHere is a package repo for the driver. In case there will ever be updates I'll update that one too.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget -O - http://p.l42.at/signing-pub.key | sudo apt-key add -\r\necho \"deb http://p.l42.at/debian wheezy main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rr272x.list\r\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install rr272x-dkms\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
