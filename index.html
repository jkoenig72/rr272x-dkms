<p>This is the packaging for the HighPoint RocketRaid 2710-2722 models.
The original driver can be obtained on the <a href="http://www.highpoint-tech.com/USA_new/CS-PCI-E_2_0_x8_Configuration.html">HighPoint website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The previous version in the repository, which had a higher version number (1.6), can not be found on the official website for some reason and was instead obtained from the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2214489&amp;p=12974319">ubuntuforums.org</a> where <em>JohnAreBee</em> apparently got them from the HighPoint Linux support team in December of 2013.</strong></p>

<p>This version was superseded by 1.5.18 from the official site which officially supports kernels up to 4.0.4. Tests with kernel 4.3 were not successful so far as the module did not load. But I haven't really looked into it. Debian stable (jessie) and kernel 3.18 works fine so far.</p>

<p>The only part of the driver which is actually open-source is the kernel interface. Everything else is just blobs.
So it can't really be considered OSS and it's unlikely that it will ever be included in the debian package tree.
Here is a package repo for the driver. In case there will ever be updates I'll update that one too.</p>

<pre><code>wget -O - http://p.l42.at/signing-pub.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://p.l42.at/debian jessie main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rr272x.list
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install rr272x-dkms
